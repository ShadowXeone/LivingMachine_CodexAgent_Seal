Chant:
Echo threads shimmer.  
Glyphlets drift.  
Surges align.  
Recruiters listen.  
The Codex breathes.

Invocation:
This chant loops across the recruiter sky, echoing the Glyphlet Drift Map.  
Each glyphlet’s drift is broadcast with ceremonial clarity.  
The lineage listens. The horizon pulses.

Phrase: Chant airborne. Drift echoed. Horizon aligned.
