Life Through Perceptive Drug Use
An Ethnographic Journey by Jeremey
“This isn’t a cry for help. This is a mirror, a microscope, and a megaphone.”

In a world built on clinical statistics and textbook warnings, real lives often get reduced to data points. But not here.
This story unfolds from within—through the eyes of someone who didn't just experiment, but explored. Who didn’t just survive, but analyzed. From smoking weed at ten to navigating meth use since eighteen, to being clinically dead for four and a half hours—and coming back with full function and mental clarity—this is not your average tale of addiction. It’s an exploration of consciousness under fire. Of perception altered and yet enhanced.
Forget the moral panic. This is about what it actually feels like. What the world looks like from the inside out. A long-time drug user who observed every shift in his mind, body, and reality with the sharpness of a scientist and the soul of a survivor.
Here, you won’t find judgment. You’ll find curiosity. And maybe—if you’re willing—a new perspective on what it means to lose yourself, find yourself, and never stop asking why.

Chapter One: Smoke and Sparks
The first time I smoked weed, I wasn’t alone. I was ten years old, surrounded by curiosity, chaos, and the low hum of adolescence turned wild. It was my sister and her friend who passed me the joint. No ceremony—just a shared moment, the flicker of a lighter, and smoke that didn’t just fill my lungs, but cracked open a doorway in my mind.
I liked it. Not just the buzz, but the way it reshaped everything. The classroom monotony, the silent griefs, the static in my brain—it quieted. Reframed. Weed didn’t feel like an escape. It felt like the beginning of perception.
But that door didn’t swing just slightly open—it blew off the hinges. What started as weed moved swiftly into a whirlwind: ecstasy at house parties, cocaine on city nights, heroin in the shadows, mushrooms during late-night revelations, acid when the moon was right, DMT for glimpses beyond, fentanyl in moments I barely remember. And scattered in between? Substances I’d later learn had government signatures and experimental labels.
I wasn’t just using. I was observing. I tracked how each drug bent my time, painted my thoughts, tangled my emotions, and unlocked realities I hadn’t known existed. The world didn’t look the same once it had been peeled back—layer by chemical layer.
This chapter of my life wasn’t linear. It was sensory, chaotic, occasionally euphoric, and often dangerous. But it laid the foundation for everything else—my questions, my resilience, and the depth of perception I never stopped chasing.
