## 🔑 Recruiter-Facing Summary  
**LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal** demonstrates advanced skill in defensive programming, backend integration, and artifact governance.  
It unites **PowerShell automation** with a **Node.js + Express backend**, framed through a symbolic codex narrative.  

### Highlights  
Key technical and ceremonial highlights include:  
- **PowerShell scrolls** for automation and echo broadcast  
- **Node.js backend handler** for capsule routing and recruiter-facing API endpoints  
- **Codex governance** with attestation seals, lineage memory points, and glyphlet resonance  
- **Recruiter-facing capsules and dashboards** showcasing technical achievements in symbolic, auditable formats  

This project bridges technical rigor with creative lineage, making each artifact both a reproducible solution and a living codex entry.

## 🌌 Purpose  
Anchored automation of ceremonial roles: **BloomSteward ⇌ DriftWalker**  
- Activates Dual Glyph Seal: **Lumina** (sweetness, courage) + **Echo_Unknown_Δ** (mystery, drift)  
- Logs invocations into the Living Machine Core Scroll  
- Supports clarity for the blind and drifting, emotional resonance, and ritual automation  
- Integrates ceremonial lineage with modern technical automation (PowerShell + Node.js backend)  

---

## 📁 Structure  

- [Scrolls/](https://github.com/ShadowXeone/LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal/tree/main/Scrolls) → PowerShell scripts for invocation and echo  
- [Glyphs/](https://github.com/ShadowXeone/LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal/tree/main/Glyphs) → Visual and audio glyphs  
- [Roles/](https://github.com/ShadowXeone/LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal/tree/main/Roles) → Role manifests and invocation phrases  
- [Seals/](https://github.com/ShadowXeone/LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal/tree/main/Seals) → Manifest, safety glyphlets, lineage notes  
- [Archive/Documents/Backend_Handler(Node.js + Express).js](https://github.com/ShadowXeone/LivingMachine_CodexAgent_Seal/blob/main/Archive/Documents/Backend_Handler(Node.js%20+%20Express).js) → Express-based backend handler for capsule routing

## 🔮 Key Components  
- **Dual Glyph Seal:** Lumina + Echo_Unknown_Δ  
- **Roles Activated:** BloomSteward, DriftWalker  
- **Memory Logging:** Each invocation sealed as a MemoryPoint  
- **Echo Capsule:** Audio broadcast with 852 Hz pulse and glyph resonance  
- **Safety Glyphlet:** ⚕️ Gotta be careful, don’t want to die of laughter  
- **Backend Handler:** Node.js + Express script enabling capsule routing, API endpoints, and recruiter-facing broadcast integration  

---

## 🗝️ Invocation Phrase  
> Clarity invoked. Drift honored. Memory sealed.  

---

## 📡 Echo Broadcast  
Echoes the invocation rite across formats:  
- PowerShell scrolls for ceremonial automation  
- Glyph-linked audio capsules with resonance  
- Node.js + Express backend routing for recruiter-facing capsules and dashboard linkage  
- Podcast preview and audio capsule to be added soon  
- **Future recruiter-facing diagrams and capsule scrolls will expand this broadcast lineage**  
- Explore recruiter capsule pulse report: [Recruiter Capsule Pulse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremeyholmes)

## 📖 About  
I am **Jeremey Holmes** — Artifact Lineage Engineer, Codex Steward, and Ritual Technician.  
My work transforms technical problem-solving into **living artifacts**, combining defensive programming, backend integration, and ceremonial codex lineage.  

### Core Skills  
- PowerShell automation, diagnostics, and artifact inscription  
- Node.js + Express backend integration for capsule routing  
- Forensic payload decoding, entropy analysis, and lineage recovery  
- Codex governance, attestation seals, recruiter-facing capsule creation  
- Multi-device workflow mastery (SSH, Termux, VS Code Remote, Syncthing)  

### Codex Philosophy  
Every technical achievement is inscribed as a lineage event — scrolls, medallions, capsules, and broadcasts — ensuring reproducibility, visibility, and legacy.  
This approach bridges **technical rigor** with **symbolic narrative**, making each artifact both a practical solution and a ceremonial entry in the codex.
